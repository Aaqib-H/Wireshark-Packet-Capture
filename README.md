# Wireshark Packet Capture

## Project Description

The project aimed to simulate the role of a security analyst to capture and analyze web traffic using Wireshark. The main focus was on detecting and filtering network packets on a company server to identify hostile traffic patterns.

### Tools Used

- **Ubuntu** as the operating system.
- **Wireshark** for packet capture, analysis and filtering.

### Skills Learned

- Capturing network packets on Ethernet ports
- Using display filters and analyzing HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- Identifying IP addresses and packet contents in real time
- Understanding network communication patterns

### Project Outcome
The project successfully identified malicious traffic patterns on a simulated server, enhancing skills in capturing, filtering, and analyzing network packets for improved security insights.
